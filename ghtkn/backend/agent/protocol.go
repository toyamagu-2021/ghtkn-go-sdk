// Package agent defines the socket protocol and client used to talk to a running
// ghtkn agent. The agent is a long-running process that caches GitHub App access
// tokens and serves them over a Unix domain socket using newline-delimited JSON.
//
// Both the agent server (in the ghtkn CLI) and the SDK's agent backend client
// depend on this package so that the wire format and socket path stay in sync.
